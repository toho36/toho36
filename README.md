### 🎯 About Me

I'm a Czech fullstack developer with a VSE degree, specializing in React and Node.js. After 2 years in frontend development, I've expanded my expertise to fullstack for the past 6 months.

As an **AI enthusiast experimenting with next-generation development workflows**, I'm constantly exploring how tools like Cursor and Claude can transform the coding experience. My approach focuses on **leveraging AI to enhance code quality and developer productivity** while maintaining a philosophy of being a **continuous learner embracing new technologies while maintaining solid fundamentals**.
